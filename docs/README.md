summary: An OpenFOAM function object for CHT, FSI, and fluid-fluid coupled simulations using preCICE.
---

## What is this?

This preCICE adapter is a plug-in (function object) for OpenFOAM, which can work with any recent version of OpenFOAM (.com / .org, see [supported OpenFOAM versions](https://precice.org/adapter-openfoam-support.html)). It supports fluid-structure interaction (fluid part), conjugate heat transfer (fluid and solid parts), and fluid-fluid simulations, while it is also easily extensible.

## What can it do?

This adapter can read/write the following fields:

- Temperature (read + write)
- Heat flux (read + write)
- Sink temperature (read + write)
- Heat transfer coefficient (read + write)
- Force (read + write)
- Stress (write)
- Displacement (read + write)
- Displacement delta (read)
- Pressure (read + write)
- Pressure gradient (read + write)
- Velocity (read + write)
- Velocity gradient (read + write)

All features of preCICE are supported, including implicit coupling and nearest-projection mapping. Even though OpenFOAM is 3D, this adapter can also work in the 2D mode of preCICE, defining only one layer of interface nodes (automatically).

## Try

Here you will find how to [get the adapter](https://precice.org/adapter-openfoam-get.html), how to [configure](https://precice.org/adapter-openfoam-config.html) a case, how to [extend the adapter](https://precice.org/adapter-openfoam-extend.html) to cover additional features, as well as a few notes on [supported OpenFOAM versions](https://precice.org/adapter-openfoam-support.html).

## Learn

Apart from following the documentation here, you will also often find us in OpenFOAM-related conferences.
Before diving into preCICE and the OpenFOAM adapter for the first time, you may want to watch the recording of

## History

This project is actively maintained on [precice/openfoam-adapter](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter). Current maintainers: [@MakisH](https://github.com/MakisH/) and [@DavidSCN](https://github.com/DavidSCN).

This adapter was developed as part of [Gerasimos Chourdakis' master's thesis](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1462269) [2].
It is based on [previous work](https://github.com/ludcila/CHT-preCICE) by Lucia Cheung ([master's thesis](https://www5.in.tum.de/pub/Cheung2016_Thesis.pdf) [3], in cooperation with [SimScale](https://www.simscale.com/)).

The fluid-structure interaction module was developed in close collaboration between Gerasimos Chourdakis and Derek Risseeuw (TU Delft), in the context of the [master's thesis of the latter](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:70beddde-e870-4c62-9a2f-8758b4e49123) [4]. We would also like to thank David Schneider (Univ. Siegen / TUM) and Maximilian Müller (TU Braunschweig) for sharing the code and experience of their similar previous work.

The fluid-fluid coupling module was added by Gerasimos Chourdakis, in the context of his dissertation. [#67](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/67)

The adapter is [easily extensible](https://precice.org/adapter-openfoam-extend.html).
