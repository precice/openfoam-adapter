# 1. get the colon-separated paths (e.g. the CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH),
# 2. translate all the colons to new line characters, i.e. move each entry to a new line,
# 3. remove the empty lines. These would result from ":path" or "path:" or "path::path".
# 4. add the respective "-I" or "-L" in the beginning of the line,
# 5. translate the new line characters to "\", i.e. make everything again one line.
