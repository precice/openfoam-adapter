## [pre-versioning-0] 2021-04-15

### Added

- Support for reading displacements on face centers and further improved the 2D mode. [#147](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/147)
- Restrict the user in valid orientation of 2D cases with an assertion. [#155](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/155)
- New fluid-fluid coupling (FF) module. You can find a new [partitioned pipe tutorial on the website](https://precice.org/tutorials-partitioned-pipe.html). [#67](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/67)

- Moved all the `tutorials/` to the [tutorials repository](https://github.com/precice/tutorials) and the related documentation to the [preCICE website](https://precice.org/tutorials.html).
- Disabled debug messages by default, to reduce visual noise and logs length. [a942c8](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/commit/a942c8dc6a9f9ec29f0bb1d6625501657cdd8b65)
- Added `-j 4` to `wmake` in `Allwmake` to build with four threads by default. Remove this you face any issues (in which case, let us know). [#162](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/162)
- Refactored the `Force` class. [#148](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/148)

### Removed

- Dropped support for preCICE v1.x. [#157](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/157)

### Fixed

- Improved the `Allwmake` and `Allclean` scripts. [#157](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/157)
