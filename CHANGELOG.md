## [Unreleased]

### Changed

## [v1.1.0] 2022-02-08

### Added

- Added a check for data fields and supported location types of the coupling interface [#206](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/206).
- Extended the adapter's DEBUG output to print the rank in addition to the message in parallel runs
[#201](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/201).
- Added a custom build GitHub workflow to check building the adapter with any supported OpenFOAM version [#214](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/214).
- Added a release pull request template and documented the versioning strategy and release artifact names. [#216](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/216)
- Added a hint to also cite the adapter, at the end of the coupling. [#218](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/218)

### Changed

- Removed explicit casting of boundary conditions in the adapter's write function in order to allow more boundary conditions to be compatible with the adapter (e.g. groovyBC) [#195](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/195).
- Cleaned-up the handling of adding checkpoint fields and replaced various unnecessary copies by references [#209](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/209).
- OpenFOAM version bumped to v2112 in GitHub Actions (including preCICE v2.2.1 --> v2.3.0) and documentation. GitHub Action clang-format-action switched to its main branch. [#211](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/211).
- Disabled automatic checking of links in GitHub Actions. This is now a manual workflow [#215](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/215).

### Fixed

- Fixed a potential memory access issue in the xy-alignment check for parallel 2D cases [#202](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/issues/202).
- Fixed a bug that was not allowing more than one module at the same time and added an error message for the case when a dataset is not known by any or too many modules. [#197](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/197).
- Fixed the misplaced data reading in the adapter 'advance' function [#188](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/188).

## [v1.0.0] 2021-04-29

### Added

- Automatic code formatting with clang-format. [#173](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/173)
- GitHub actions to build the adapter with OpenFOAM v2012 and to check shell scripts, documentation formatting, and links. [#165](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/165) [#164](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/164) [#169](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/169) [#171](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/171)
- Status of the project in `README.md`: CI badges, license, maintainers, links to issues. [#167](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/167)
- Code of conduct, to ensure a safe environment for the community. [#166](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/166)

### Changed

- Replaced the deprecated `lookupType` and `subDictPtr` calls with `get` and `findDict` (supported in OpenFOAM v1812 and later). [#176](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/176)
- This Changelog now follows the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format.

### Removed

- Automatic triggering of system tests with Travis-CI. We will reimplement this later. [#165](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/165)

## [pre-versioning-0] 2021-04-15

### Added

- Support for reading displacements on face centers and further improved the 2D mode. [#147](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/147)
- Restrict the user in valid orientation of 2D cases with an assertion. [#155](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/155)
- New fluid-fluid coupling (FF) module. You can find a new [partitioned pipe tutorial on the website](https://precice.org/tutorials-partitioned-pipe.html). [#67](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/67)

### Changed

- Moved the wiki pages into the `docs/` folder here. These pages are now rendered in the [new adapter documentation](https://precice.org/adapter-openfoam-overview.html).
- Moved all the `tutorials/` to the [tutorials repository](https://github.com/precice/tutorials) and the related documentation to the [preCICE website](https://precice.org/tutorials.html).
- Disabled debug messages by default, to reduce visual noise and logs length. [a942c8](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/commit/a942c8dc6a9f9ec29f0bb1d6625501657cdd8b65)
- Added `-j 4` to `wmake` in `Allwmake` to build with four threads by default. Remove this you face any issues (in which case, let us know). [#162](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/162)
- Refactored the `Force` class. [#148](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/148)

### Removed

- Dropped support for preCICE v1.x. [#157](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/157)

### Fixed

- Improved the `Allwmake` and `Allclean` scripts. [#157](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/157)
- Cleaned up a few non-const references to boundary fields. [#132](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/132)
