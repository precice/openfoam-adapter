_**Note:** This adapter is currently in a testing phase. Please [report any issues](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/issues) here and give us feedback through the [preCICE mailing list](https://mailman.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/mailman/listinfo/precice)._

This adapter was developed as part of [Gerasimos Chourdakis' master's thesis](https://www5.in.tum.de/pub/Chourdakis2017_Thesis.pdf) [1].
It is based on [previous work](https://github.com/ludcila/CHT-preCICE) by Lucia Cheung ([master's thesis](https://www5.in.tum.de/pub/Cheung2016_Thesis.pdf) [2], in cooperation with [SimScale](https://www.simscale.com/)).

The fluid-structure interaction module was developed in close collaboration between Gerasimos Chourdakis and Derek Risseeuw (TU Delft), in the context of the [master's thesis of the latter](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:70beddde-e870-4c62-9a2f-8758b4e49123) [3]. We would also like to thank David Schneider (Univ. Siegen / TUM) and Maximilian Müller (TU Braunschweig) for sharing the code and experience of their similar previous work.

The adapter is [easily extensible](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/wiki/How-to-extend-the-adapter) and support for fluid-fluid multi-model coupling [is planned](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/issues/60).

## Start here

Our [wiki](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/wiki) will help you start. 

You may find OpenFOAM-only tutorials here, in order to test your installation, or cases involving other adapters in the [precice/tutorials](https://github.com/precice/tutorials) repository. Step-by-step instructions for them are provided in the [preCICE wiki](https://github.com/precice/precice/wiki).
