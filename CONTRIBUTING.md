# Contributing to the OpenFOAM-preCICE adapter

Hi there! Amazing that you want to contribute to this project!
Please have a look at the page [contributing to preCICE](https://precice.org/community-contribute-to-precice.html)
and watch out for more specific details in this file.

## Changelog

Instead of directly editing `CHANGELOG.md`, please add a file `123.md`
in `changelog-entries`, where `123` your pull request number. This helps reduce
merge conflicts and we will merge these files at the time we release a new version.

## Code formatting

You can format all files with clang-format 11 by running `./tools/format-code.sh`.
